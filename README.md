# LBC Paper Wallet

This website will allow users to generate LBRY Credit (LBC) addresses and their corresponding private keys. These addresses can be printed for offline storage. You can also view private key address details. 

This project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable, not minified and contains no XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded.

## Installation

This generator can be installed by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/lbryio/lbc-paper-wallet/archive/master.zip) and extracting it anywhere on your local file system. The green download button on GitHub can also be used. 

## Usage

For maximum security, this site should be run on an airgapped computer (clean machine, disconnected from the internet). After extracting the source code, open the `index-SHA256-*.html` file with your browser which will load the site locally. You can now generate some randomness into the process and then create a single wallet (address or paper wallet form), brainwallet (based on passphrase), split wallet (combine n of m shares to generate private key) or view wallet details (based on a private key).
